# Sanity Asset Source Plugin: Imageshop

Imageshop is a complete Digital Asset Management system (DAM system) for organizing and sharing images, videos and documents. This plugin integrates Imageshop image picker neatly into Sanity, so that you can access all your company's images inside Sanity CMS with only one click. You can also upload photos to Imageshop without leaving Sanity.

> This is a **Sanity Studio v3** plugin. If you are still on sanity V2, [see the V2 plugin here](https://github.com/Keyteq/sanity-plugin-asset-source-imageshop)

## Installation

```sh
npm install @imageshop-org/sanity-plugin-asset-source-imageshop
```

## Usage

Add it as a plugin in `sanity.config.ts` (or .js):


```ts
import {defineConfig} from 'sanity'
import {imageShopAsset} from '@imageshop-org/sanity-plugin-asset-source-imageshop'

export default defineConfig({
  //...
  plugins: [
    imageShopAsset({})
  ],
})
```

> **Note** When using the plugin for the first time, a popup will show where you provide your Imageshop API key. The API key will be stored securely in your sanity db using the @sanity/secrets package.

## Enable multi batch upload

If you have an array of type `image`, you can enable multi batch upload like this with the `options.batchUpload` set to `true`.

If batchUpload is enabled, another button will appear, which allows you to select multiple images and add them to the array.

```
const imagesField = {
  name: 'images',
  title: 'Images',
  type: 'array',
  options: {
    batchUpload: true
  },
  of: [
    {
      name: 'image',
      type: 'image',
      title: 'Image',
      options: {
        hotspot: true
      },
      validation: Rule => [Rule.required().error('Image is required')],
    }
  ]
}

```


## Enable multi language text selection

If your sanity have multiple language you need to implement a language resolver, we need to know where to get the texts from in imageshop.


```js
imageShopAsset({
  languageResolver: () => {
    // This really depends on how you have implemented some kind of language context in sanity, where user
    // can switch language based on a select menu.

    // Here you can get the current language in e.g. localstorage in your sanity client. 
    // Then you return a valid imageshop language based on this.
    // example:
    const currentLanguage = "nb";  // get from localstorage ?

    if (currentLanguage == "nb") {
      return "no";
    }

    // Default return some language that is valid.
    return "no";
  }
})

```

## Custom fields for multiuploaded images

If you want to assign custom `fields` on the image object, you can create a custom field-mapper, which you can get texts from imageshop and then transfer the texts to the sanity image objects fields.


```js
imageShopAsset({
  // Should return the sanityAssetDocumentProps after it's transformed.
  // imageShopData = data from imageshop. 
  // sanityAssetDocumentProps = the sanity image asset document props
  fieldMapper: (sanityAssetDocumentProps, imageShopData) => {
    // Do custom mapping of fields here. Example:
    console.log({ sanityAssetDocumentProps, imageShopData })

    sanityAssetDocumentProps.altText = imageShopData?.text.no.title
    sanityAssetDocumentProps.creditLine = imageShopData?.text.no.credits

    return sanityAssetDocumentProps
  }
});

```

The **imageShopData** object the image data that is stored in imageshop. The object contains the following data:


```typescript
type ImageShopAsset = {
  documentId: string
  code: string
  extraInfo: null | string
  AuthorName: null | string
  image: {
    file: string
    width: number
    height: number
    thumbnail: string
  }
  text: {
    [k: string]: {
      title: string
      description: string
      rights: string
      credits: string
      tags: string
      categories: string[]
    }
  }
  InterfaceList: Array<{
    InterfaceID: number
    InterfaceName: string
  }>
  profile: any
}
```
